# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For my final Tableau project, the goal is to analyze and visualize FIFA 18 player stats data to gain insights into player performance, identify trends, and create an interactive dashboard for easy exploration.

## Process
Step 1: Connect Data
I started by connecting the FIFA 18 player stats dataset to Tableau, exploring the structure of the data and ensuring it was suitable for analysis.

Step 2: Data Exploration
I carefully examined the dataset, checking for missing values, detecting data types, and identifying key features that could be crucial for my analysis.

## Results
I chose Option 2 for my project. I selected the "fif18_clean.csv" dataset, which contains comprehensive player statistics from FIFA 2018.

Top 10 Countries with Best Average Potential (Map):

I created a map visualization to showcase the average potential of players from different countries. This helps in identifying countries with a high potential pool, aiding in the search for "wonder kids."
Cluster Analysis (Scatter Plot):

I performed a cluster analysis based on player age and value. The scatter plot visualizes three clusters, helping to categorize players into different segments based on their age and market value.

Data Question (for Option 2):
Question: How can we categorize players based on age and market value to understand different player profiles?

## Challenges 
Data Cleaning:

Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values posed challenges. Ensuring data integrity was crucial for accurate analysis.
Interactivity:

Creating an interactive dashboard with seamless filters and actions required careful consideration to enhance user experience.
Cluster Interpretation:

Interpreting and labeling clusters accurately was challenging. Ensuring the clusters represented meaningful player profiles was key.

## Future Goals
Given more time, I would:

Explore additional visualizations to uncover more insights.
Enhance the interactivity of the dashboard for a more user-friendly experience.
Conduct deeper analysis, such as player comparisons within clusters.
Incorporate more advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling if additional data becomes available.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into player performance and set the foundation for continued exploration and analysis in the dynamic world of FIFA 18 player statistics.
