# Final-Project-Tableau

## Project/Goals
For my final Tableau project, the goal is to analyze and visualize FIFA 18 player stats data to gain insights into player performance, identify trends, and create an interactive dashboard for easy exploration.

## Process
Step 1: Connect Data
I initiated the project by connecting the FIFA 18 player stats dataset to Tableau. This involved exploring the structure of the data, assessing its format, and ensuring it was suitable for analysis within the Tableau environment.

Step 2: Data Exploration
Upon establishing the connection, I delved into a thorough examination of the dataset. This process involved meticulous checks for missing values, detection of data types, and identification of key features that could significantly impact the analysis. Notably, during this stage, it was observed that the dataset did not include date-type data, limiting the ability to perform time-series analyses or forecasting based on temporal trends.

While creating the visualizations, a further observation was made regarding the accessibility of some links for logo photos and flags. Unfortunately, due to potential changes in the data source or external factors affecting the availability of these resources, certain visual elements, such as team logos or flags, may not be displayed as intended.

## Results
I chose Option 2 for my project. I selected the "fif18_clean.csv" dataset, which contains comprehensive player statistics from FIFA 2018.

Top 10 Countries with Best Average Potential (Map):

I created a map visualization to showcase the average potential of players from different countries. This helps in identifying countries with a high potential pool, aiding in the search for "wonder kids."("Wonder kids" is a term commonly used in the world of football (soccer) to refer to exceptionally talented and promising young players who exhibit outstanding skills, potential, and maturity beyond their age).

When hovering over each data point, the tooltip displays additional information, including nationality, overall rating, potential, and wage.


Cluster Analysis (Scatter Plot):

I performed a cluster analysis based on player age and value. The scatter plot visualizes three clusters, helping to categorize players into different segments based on their age and market value.

Data Question (for Option 2):
Question: How can we categorize players based on age and market value to understand different player profiles?

## Challenges 
Data Cleaning:

Cleaning the dataset and handling missing values posed challenges. Ensuring data integrity was crucial for accurate analysis.
Interactivity:

Creating an interactive dashboard with seamless filters and actions required careful consideration to enhance user experience.
Cluster Interpretation:

Interpreting and labeling clusters accurately was challenging. Ensuring the clusters represented meaningful player profiles was key.

## Future Goals
Given more time, I would:

Explore additional visualizations to uncover more insights.
Enhance the interactivity of the dashboard for a more user-friendly experience.
Conduct deeper analysis, such as player comparisons within clusters.
Incorporate more advanced analytics, such as predictive modeling if additional data becomes available.

Overall, the project provided valuable insights into player performance and set the foundation for continued exploration and analysis in the dynamic world of FIFA 18 player statistics.
